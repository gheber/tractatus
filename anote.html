<p><i>In rendering Mr Wittgenstein's</i> Tractatus
Logico-Philosophicus <i>available for English readers, the
somewhat unusual course has been adopted of printing the
original side by side with the translation.  Such a method
of presentation seemed desirable both on account of the obvious
difficulties raised by the vocabulary and in view of the
peculiar literary character of the whole.  As a result, a
certain latitude has been possible in passages to which
objection might otherwise be taken as over-literal.</i>

<p><i>The proofs of the translation and the version of the
original which appeared in the final number of Ostwald's</i>
Annalen der Naturphilosophie (1922) <i>have been very carefully
revised by the author himself; and the Editor further desires
to express his indebtedness to Mr F. P. Ramsey, of Trinity
College, Cambridge, for assistance both with the translation
and in the preparation of the book for the press.</i></p>
